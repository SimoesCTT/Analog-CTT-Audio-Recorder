## 1. TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW

CTT Analog Studio is the world's first true analog recording system for digital computers. It uses Convergent Time Theory (CTT) and the fundamental constant α_RH = ln(φ)/(2π) to encode audio as continuous phase relationships rather than discrete samples.

**Key Capabilities:**
- 4-track simultaneous analog recording
- 100:1 lossless compression
- Phase-perfect reconstruction (correlation > 0.99)
- No sampling, no quantization, no digital artifacts
